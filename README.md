The Star Wars app uses a public API to get the planets, starships, species, people and films data. You can visit the API at https://swapi.co/api/

Every component in the app has a search bar that can be used to search for a planet, person, film and so on. Take into account that the Search Bar will not find what you are looking for, if it is not typed correctly.
